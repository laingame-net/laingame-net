Please take them in the good spirit in which they were given.\r\n\r\n1. File XV0025 is a complete cinematic sequence that one can only see in the game by reaching Cou053, Lda237, Tda092 or Dia048. The PS1 game software excludes the relevant Dcl0nn portions of XV0025 if Dcl0nn files had not been yet reached by the player at that point. So XV0025 gives away so much as to make playing the game significantly less interesting.\r\n\r\n2. If I remember correctly, only reaching Cou053, Lda237, Tda092 or Dia048 and choosing to `Continue` the game rather than `Quit`ing it reveals TakNNN files in some sequence to be discovered by the player. The cinematic that is played when TakNNN files are opened is a simple \'GIF\' video file of Lain. The voice is either Lain\'s or Touko\'s.\r\n\r\n3. I had already posted my suggestion earlier to possibly warn minors and other sensitive people of the difficult nature of the story line and the visuals.\r\n\r\nThank you for an amazing piece of work. The creator of the tool you had used to extract the files had acknowledged and thanked you in his blog for your giving him credit for the tool creation.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\nDmitry Volovik',1,2),('2013-05-25 14:48:26','Geyzer','Круто сделал!)',1,3),('2013-06-13 12:38:46','Morb','О, работает, спасибо.
